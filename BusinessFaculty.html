            The architectural design of Wenzhou-Kean University campus seeks diverse changes, providing great space for
            innovative campus design. The campus does not insist on unified coordination, but encourages buildings to
            communicate and dialogue in diversity, and find ways and methods of balance and coordination.
            <br>

            Therefore, unlike other buildings on campus, the business school adds a bit of personality and vitality to
            the Wenzhou-Kean University campus with its modern design style and bright color matching. At the same time,
            the business school's facade color selection and large steps and other design elements echo the existing
            campus buildings, forming communication and dialogue in diversified development.
