            The comprehensive gymnasium is located in the northwest of the central campus area of ​​the school, facing
            the outdoor fountain square and the business school in the south, and close to the student learning and
            activity center, dormitory area, etc. The first floor of the comprehensive gymnasium has a gymnastics room,
            dance room, table tennis room, etc., and the second floor has a basketball court, badminton court, and
            doubles squash court. The basement is the campus public equipment center.

            The architectural shape adopts a simple and modern style, which is coordinated with the business school to
            the south and the student learning and activity center to the east. The overall building is a simple and
            regular L-shape. The large area of ​​transparent glass curtain wall on the first floor introduces sufficient
            light into the gymnastics room, dance room and other spaces, and interacts with the square in the south. The
            large space of the second-floor stadium is designed with five rhythmic super-long horizontal strip windows,
            which introduce comfortable ventilation and soft lighting into the interior, and at the same time give the
            comprehensive gymnasium innovative and dynamic architectural features.
