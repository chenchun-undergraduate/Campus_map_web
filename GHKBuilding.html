      The Ge He Kai Building is located on the central axis of the Wenzhou-Kean University campus.
      It is the "front door" of the campus and the first building that campus visitors see. The
      south side of the building faces the crescent-shaped lawn in front of the building, where
      formal events such as the opening ceremony are held. The north side of the building faces the
      lake and the Student Learning and Activity Center, which is the "crossroads" of the campus.
      The building facade is designed with an asymmetrical design to express an open and lively
      intention. The rooftop viewing platform on the third floor is a key feature of the building
      design. People can climb this special roof garden and walk throughout the platform to enjoy
      the views of the campus from all directions, day and night.
